# tighe

This project was designed for Ms. Tighe of the Jessy Clark Middle School, for her and her students. 
Initially I wanted to write some easy and reable Python software to take attendance, make and grade quizzes,
and eventually be an integral part of a classroom environment. You can picture tighe.py as a simple database
management system in that all files it uses must be in the same folder (or a daughter folder) as the program.
